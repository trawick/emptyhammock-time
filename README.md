## Time-related utilities for Python

## Support

This package exists to support my own commercial activities.  Just maybe it can
provide other developers with a helpful hint, or even more.  Feel free to open
Github issues for suggestions or suspected problems, but please don't expect me
to volunteer any time to respond or otherwise address them directly.  Think of
Github issues for this project as a way to document something you'd like me to
be aware of when fixing problems or implementing future requirements.
